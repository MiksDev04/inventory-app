## ðŸ“‹ DESIGN PROMPT

**Context:** You are designing for a professional inventory management system used by businesses for stock tracking, supplier management, and transaction logging.

**Design Requirements:**

### Visual Style
- **Modern, clean, professional interface** with a vibrant but trustworthy appearance
- **Contemporary design trends** with subtle depth and sophistication
- **Business-focused aesthetic** that conveys reliability and efficiency
- **Fresh, non-gloomy color palette** that energizes users while maintaining professionalism

### Color Palette
- **Primary:** Blue gradient system (#3b82f6 to #1d4ed8) for main actions and navigation
- **Success:** Green (#22c55e) for positive actions, confirmations, in-stock items
- **Warning:** Amber (#f59e0b) for alerts, low stock warnings, caution states
- **Error:** Red (#ef4444) for errors, out-of-stock, destructive actions
- **Neutral:** Modern gray scale (#f9fafb to #111827) for text and backgrounds
- **Background:** Clean whites (#ffffff) with light gray accents (#f8fafc, #f1f5f9)

### Typography
- **Primary Font:** Inter (modern, clean, highly readable)
- **Hierarchy:** Bold headings (700 weight), medium subheadings (600), regular body text (400-500)
- **Monospace:** For SKUs, codes, and technical data
- **Clear visual hierarchy** with proper contrast and spacing

### Component Style
- **Cards:** 12px border radius, subtle shadows, hover effects with slight elevation
- **Buttons:** 8px border radius, gradient backgrounds, hover animations (slight lift)
- **Forms:** Clean inputs with 8px radius, focus states with colored borders and subtle glow
- **Tables:** Rounded corners, alternating row colors, hover states, proper padding
- **Modals:** 16px border radius, backdrop blur, prominent shadows

### Layout & Spacing
- **8px grid system** (use multiples of 8: 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 40px)
- **Generous white space** for breathing room and clarity
- **Consistent padding** in cards (24px), forms (12px), and containers
- **Proper visual hierarchy** with clear sections and groupings

### Interactions & Animations
- **Smooth transitions** (0.3s ease) for all interactive elements
- **Hover effects:** Subtle lift (2-4px) for cards and buttons
- **Loading states:** Pulse animations or skeleton loading
- **Micro-interactions:** Button press feedback, form validation animations
- **Page transitions:** Smooth fade-in effects

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile-first approach** with clean mobile layouts
- **Breakpoints:** 576px, 768px, 992px, 1200px, 1400px
- **Touch-friendly** buttons and controls on mobile
- **Adaptive navigation** that works on all screen sizes

### Business Context Elements
- **Role-based UI:** Different interfaces for Admin vs Staff users
- **Dashboard widgets:** Statistics cards with colored borders and gradient backgrounds
- **Status indicators:** Color-coded badges for stock levels, transaction types
- **Data visualization:** Clean charts and graphs when needed
- **Professional iconography:** Consistent icon style throughout

### Accessibility
- **High contrast ratios** for text readability
- **Focus indicators** for keyboard navigation
- **Semantic HTML structure** for screen readers
- **Proper color usage** that doesn't rely solely on color for meaning

### Specific Component Guidelines
- **Navigation:** Gradient blue background with glass morphism effect
- **Statistics Cards:** Light gradient backgrounds with colored left borders
- **Alert Badges:** Gradient backgrounds matching semantic colors
- **Forms:** Clean, spacious layouts with proper validation states
- **Tables:** Professional appearance with good data density
- **Modals:** Prominent but not overwhelming, proper backdrop

### Avoid
- Dark, gloomy, or depressing color schemes
- Overly complex layouts that confuse users
- Inconsistent spacing or typography
- Outdated design patterns
- Poor contrast or accessibility issues

**Output:** Create a [component/page] that follows these design principles, ensuring it looks modern, professional, and user-friendly while maintaining consistency with the overall system design.
